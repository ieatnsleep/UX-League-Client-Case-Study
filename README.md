League Client UX Case Study
This case study explores the evolution of the League of Legends client’s user interface (UI) from 2016 to 2024, focusing on usability, navigation flows, and user experience (UX) principles such as Fitts’s Law. Through this analysis, I identify core design changes, evaluate their impact on returning and new players, and propose recommendations for enhancing the overall experience.

## Analysis of Key UI Changes

### 1. Play Button & Visual Hierarchy
- **Observation:** The “Play” button moved from top-center (2016) to top-left (2017/2024).  
- **Importance:** As the primary call-to-action, the button is visually emphasized with bold or contrasting colors.  
- **UX Outcome:** This consistent prominence aligns with its importance—players instantly know where to go to start a game.

### 2. Navigation Bar & Profile Accessibility
- **2017 Client:** Introduced a top navigation bar with “Play,” “Profile,” and “Collection.” Meanwhile, the profile section shrank into a small circular icon at the top right.  
- **Fitts’s Law Insight:** Users who want to quickly access profile details must move the cursor away from the profile avatar to the navigation bar’s “Profile” button—an additional movement that may be unintuitive.  
- **Potential Confusion:** Clicking on the avatar only changes the profile picture, rather than opening the entire profile.

### 3. Home & TFT in 2024 Client
- **Key Changes:** The navigation bar now displays “Home” and “TFT” instead of “Profile” and “Collection.”  
- **Profile Access:** Must be done via the small circular avatar at the top right. Smaller clickable targets can slow user interaction and cause confusion.  
- **Benefits:** The new “Home” button provides a clear, universal path to return to the client’s main page.

### 4. Profile Page Customization
- **Improvements:** Users can now display champion skins or aesthetics on their profile, offering a more personalized feel compared to the plain 2016 background.  
- **Tradeoff:** Important stats (e.g., rank, champion mastery) are relegated to smaller icons or hover states, reducing immediate visibility.

### 5. Profile Navigation Reduction
- **2016 Profile Navigation:** Contained up to 8 sections (e.g., item sets, runes, etc.).  
- **2024 Profile Navigation:** Reduced to 5 main sections, streamlining content and focusing primarily on match history and rank. Other pages (e.g., runes, skins) moved to dedicated icons on the **Home** screen.  
- **Outcome:** New users can access these pages with a single click from the home page, while returning users might be confused initially.

### 6. Crafting Flow Changes
- **Previous Flow (2016):** Directly open “Crafting” page from the “Crafting” button.  
- **New Flow (2024):** (Home > Crafting button > Premium skins promotion page > “Crafting” link > Crafting page).  
- **Business vs. UX:** This change likely aims to push skin sales by showing users a premium storefront before granting access to crafting. It adds extra steps (and friction) to a frequently used feature.

## Impact on User Experience
1. **Increased Cognitive Load**: Frequent changes to the location of critical buttons force returning users to relearn workflows.  
2. **Additional Clicks**: Certain tasks (like accessing the crafting page) require more user actions, impeding convenience.  
3. **Improved Aesthetics**: The shift toward more customizable UI elements and updated visuals enhances the emotional connection and overall brand image.  
4. **Clear Home Path**: The introduction of a dedicated “Home” button reduces the guesswork in returning to the main screen.

---

## Recommendations
1. **Consistent Profile Access**  
   - Keep the profile icon and its dropdown actions consistent. If a “Profile” tab is introduced in one version, consider retaining a related or complementary icon to reduce confusion.

2. **Balancing Business & UX**  
   - Showcase premium skins on the **Home** page rather than forcing an extra step in the crafting flow.

3. **Streamlined Navigation**  
   - Ensure top-level icons/labels are clearly grouped. Related features (e.g., profile avatar and profile page) should reside within the same clickable area or menu.

4. **Leverage Hover States & Tooltips**  
   - For champion mastery or rank icons in the 2024 client, tooltips can provide immediate info, while clickable expansion allows deep dives without cluttering the interface.

5. **User Testing & Iteration**  
   - Conduct user tests to validate if the new home-based icons truly reduce clicks for new players, and monitor if returning users adapt smoothly or experience frustration.

## Proposed Home Page Redesign
One suggested approach:
1. **Prominent Premium Skins Banner** at the main section of the home screen, so users immediately see the promotional content.  
2. **Dedicated “Crafting” Button** in the top navigation bar or large icon in a consistent, intuitive location.  

---

## Conclusion & Key Takeaways
- **Balancing Business & UX**: While pushing premium content can drive revenue, each additional click or hidden path diminishes user satisfaction.  
- **Consistency Matters**: Frequent UI changes can alienate returning players. Gradual, well-communicated modifications improve adoption and satisfaction.  
- **Fitts’s Law Still Applies**: Button size, distance, and predictability significantly influence ease of navigation—particularly for high-traffic pages like “Play,” “Profile,” and “Crafting.”  
- **Customization Benefits**: Allowing players to personalize their profile fosters brand loyalty and emotional investment in the game.

Overall, the League client’s redesign from 2016 to 2024 offers both aesthetic improvements and functional challenges. By aligning future updates with user-centered design principles—while acknowledging the need to monetize—developers can continue enhancing the client in ways that delight both new and returning players.
